My personal website - an Open Source ASP.NET MVC 5 Blog.

# About

Inspired by GitHub Pages and Jekyll this is a C# blog engine which renders static HTML pages.

My preferred choice of markup language was plain HTML because it gives me more flexibility than markdown.

However this is only a small implementation detail and can be easily changed by providing a different implementation of ```DustedCodes.Core.Data.LocalStorage.IArticleParser```.

Feel free to fork it and create your own nerdy space in the world wide web!
