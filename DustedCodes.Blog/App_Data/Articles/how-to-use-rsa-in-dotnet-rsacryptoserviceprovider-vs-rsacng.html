    Title: How to use RSA in .NET - RSACryptoServiceProvider vs. RSACng
    Tags: dotnet rsa security asymmetric-encryption cryptography

<p>In my last blog post I wrote a little <a href="http://dusted.codes/the-beauty-of-asymmetric-encryption-rsa-crash-course-for-developers">crash course on RSA and how it works</a> without looking into any specific language implementations. Today I want to explore the native implementations of .NET and the new <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacng(v=vs.110).aspx">RSACng</a> class which has been recently added with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms171868.aspx#v46">.NET Framework 4.6</a>.</p>
