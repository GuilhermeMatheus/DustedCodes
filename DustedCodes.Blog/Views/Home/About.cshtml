    <p>Hi, Welcome to my personal website, programming playground and software engineering blog! I'm Dustin, a software geek and developer originally from Vienna, Austria, but currently living in the UK for the last <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dustinmoris/DustedCodes/master/DustedCodes.Blog/ViewModels/Home/AboutViewModel.cs">@AboutViewModel.YearsLivingInLondon.ToString("F") years</a>.</p>
    <p>Currently I work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.questionmark.com/">Questionmark</a> in their beautiful office in the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=beautiful+city+of+london&tbm=isch">City of London</a>. I work with multiple teams across multiple time zones in a very agile environment. Even though I call myself a .NET developer I deal with a great variety of different technologies every day, which are not part of the Microsoft stack.</p>
    <p>
        However, this website is not linked to my current employer and is entirely my own personal space, where I can share experiences, thoughts and ideas with other fellow developers who love programming just as much as I do.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Dusted Codes?</h2>
    <p>Early 2015 I started this blog as a little interesting and fun side project at home. Being impressed with the idea of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> I wanted something similar in C# and .NET and eventually created this ASP.NET MVC blog engine myself.</p>
    <p>Most of the time I blog about web development topics with a strong focus on C# and .NET, agile methologies, web security concerns, good practise patterns, tools and other general programming subjects.</p>
    <p>This blog is an <a href="https://github.com/dustinmoris/DustedCodes">open source project on GitHub</a> and runs in Windows Azure.
    </p>
